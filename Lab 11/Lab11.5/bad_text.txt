I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me
