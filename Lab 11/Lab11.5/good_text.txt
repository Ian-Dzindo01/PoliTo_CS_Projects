I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' **** at the pilot (Fly **** only)
*****s be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' **** like they violent (*****s is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these *****s gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these *****s gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your ***** caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
*****s barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you *****s, would you fuck around and do it for me
