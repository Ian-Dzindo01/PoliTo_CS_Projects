I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me
(Stunt on me, stunt on me)
I put a bullet in a nigga tryna front on me
(Front on me, front on me)
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'

So what you got a Benz? I buy my bitch a Benz
Them niggas you be fucking with, I wouldn't fuck with them
I'm on that brick shit, you still on that block shit
I sell them whole ones, you sell ten dollar rocks, bitch
Man, get your weight up, I said get your weight up
Stay in your place 'fore you get your ass sprayed up
Man, I ain't ever scared, I got all kind of guns
I'm getting plenty bread, I throw the hoes to one
Strip, bitch, you heard me? I said strip, bitch
I'm cold as ice, check the temperature on my wrist, trick
I blew three hundred grand, what kind of watch is that?
I bet you wanna know, stop tryna jack my swag, ho
Gucci, Fendi, Prada and that Louis, now I'm hotter
So it's Tom Ford and Armani, YSL, I'm fly as hell
I be Louis Vuitton swan with my hair mask on
I look good enough to eat, your bitches suck me and all fuck me

I got a clip for a nigga tryna stunt on me
(Stunt on me, stunt on me)
I put a bullet in a nigga tryna front on me
(Front on me, front on me)
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
I got that burner on me, I-I-I'm up now
I'm strapped bitch, we ballin'
