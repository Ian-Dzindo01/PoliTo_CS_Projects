Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh

I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me (You better watch your step)
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over (You better watch your step)
Y'all always tryna fuck me over

Niggas around me, yeah, they hit licks
Mix a little red and yellow when they get lit
Tryna turn up with a bad bitch
Have her in the telly doin' freak shit (you better watch your step)
Niggas sell a little bit of everythin'
Rockin' Yacht-Master and the pinky rin'
Flexing like "bitch, if you knew better"
You fuck with a real nigga and you do better (You better watch your step)
Shawty ass fat like she a stripper
That wiggle when she walk make you wanna tip her
Bartenders comin', yeah, they move quicker
Twenty, thirty bottles to the rich niggas
Everythin' cool when I'm in the room
Come with two shooters, not a hunnid goons
Nigga, don't trip, you don't want that
Boy, you gonna fuck around and get your ass capped (You better watch your step)

I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over
(You better watch your step)
Y'all always tryna fuck me over

Right before I came into this bitch hot
Needed cigarettes, I made a pit stop
Spent my life tryna be a good guy
Still people want to see me get, got
Nothin' like it ever was before
Hair fallin' out, I'm twenty years old
Got a lot of stress, that you don’t know
Still kick it like paint and this shit gold (You better watch your)
Ayy, pull up in this bitch and I’m flexin'
Jumpin' out the motherfuckin' Benz, yeah
All these damn diamonds on my necklace
Catchin' frostbite when I exit
So goddamn cold, see your breath, yeah
Hundred cigarettes then I exhale
Thousand for these fuckin' Margielas (You better watch your step)
Hundred thousand chains on my chest, yeah
Ice on my rings, ice, yeah, you see me shinin'
Two hunnid K in jewels this year, you can't tell me nothin'
And I'm gone, I ain't never sober
Me and 50 got shooters, if you tryna fuck me over, ooh (You better watch your step)
