Woo!
Yeah
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (G-Unit)
Ha ha

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go both coasts with toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that mac down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see an O.G
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must cease existing, little nigga, now listen
Your mami, your papi, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha ha, pussy
