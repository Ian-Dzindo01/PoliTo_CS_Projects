I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, I got hella hoes
I got hoes, and I'm selling dope

And I just bought a chopper, let that pussy nigga know
I got a start in these streets, extra hard for these hoes
We move hard in these streets, young God, X'ing them O's
I'm like God in these streets, got a tech in my coat
I go hard in these streets, Johnny Depp with the blow
I flip nickels and O's, I flip powder and bass
I done shoveled the snow, I done showered the state
See them flowers gon' grow and the power gon' raise
And we came through the door, here we got us a race
