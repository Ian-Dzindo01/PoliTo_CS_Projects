[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I ain't gon' let the people frisk me if I'm dirty, homie
A nigga never touched me, I got that thirty on me
Y'all tryna fuck me over, y'all always tryna fuck me over
Y'all tryna fuck me over
(You better watch your step)
Y'all always tryna fuck me over

[Verse 2: Post Malone & 50 Cent]
Right before I came into this bitch hot
Needed cigarettes, I made a pit stop
Spent my life tryna be a good guy
Still people want to see me get, got
Nothin' like it ever was before
Hair fallin' out, I'm twenty years old
Got a lot of stress, that you don’t know
Still kick it like paint and this shit gold (You better watch your)
Ayy, pull up in this bitch and I’m flexin'
Jumpin' out the motherfuckin' Benz, yeah
All these damn diamonds on my necklace
Catchin' frostbite when I exit
So goddamn cold, see your breath, yeah
