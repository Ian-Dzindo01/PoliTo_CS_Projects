[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Niggas around me, yeah, they hit licks
Mix a little red and yellow when they get lit
Tryna turn up with a bad bitch
Have her in the telly doin' freak shit (you better watch your step)
Niggas sell a little bit of everythin'
Rockin' Yacht-Master and the pinky rin'
Flexing like "bitch, if you knew better"
You fuck with a real nigga and you do better (You better watch your step)
Shawty ass fat like she a stripper
That wiggle when she walk make you wanna tip her
Bartenders comin', yeah, they move quicker
Twenty, thirty bottles to the rich niggas
Everythin' cool when I'm in the room
Come with two shooters, not a hunnid goons
Nigga, don't trip, you don't want that
Boy, you gonna fuck around and get your ass capped (You better watch your step)
