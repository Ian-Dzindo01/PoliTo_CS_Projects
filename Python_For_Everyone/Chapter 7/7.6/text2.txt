So what you sayin', boy? You a shooter, boy?
Nigga, we don't care who you shot
Nigga, quit talking money 'round rich niggas
Nigga, we don't care what you got
Bitch, I got six niggas that hit niggas, boy, I don't give a fuck
Especially when I'm lit, nigga, real shit, nigga
Send a bitch to line you up
Boy, I don't chit-chat when I click clack
I might ask a nigga, "What's up?"
Pull off in an Aston, pull up in a hooptie
Then you fuck-niggas getting fucked
Talking 'bout rapid-fire, automatic, brrrrrt, bang
Nigga, hit everybody, I said everybody
Laying right there where they stand, nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, you ain't sprayin' nothing, you ain't laying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
'Til you do something, niggas out here putting that work in
And I'm cool, nigga, like that cup I put my purp in
You ain't 'bout the strap, you ain't 'bout that knife, you ain't 'bout that life
You ain't 'bout that, that gangsta shit, you ain't 'bout that
When it's on we'll have you broad day or night, you ain't 'bout that, right?
You ain't 'bout that life, that gangsta shit, we 'bout that

Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga you ain't saying nothing
Nigga, you ain't saying nothing, nigga, you ain't saying nothing

They're not GGA, you play, I'm gon' see what's happening with ya
I don't talk it out, don't rap about it, I'm not these rap niggas
Got a maniac mind-state, will increase the crime rate
Me and every nigga on my team got a bathroom, bitch, try me
You ain't sayin' nothin', that's Twitter talk, I'm from where real niggas walk
Crackers tried to lynch me, but couldn't get me cause I'm real smart
Heart of a lion, what that mean? I got a big heart
Certified in style, been like that since a lil' boy
Nigga, who you talking to? You know what I'll do to you
Transvestite your bitch-ass, make you work out in a hula hoop
Street king, Boosie, boo, did things that turn you Christian
Let it burn, fuck the consequences, what you saying? I'll burn you
Bitches to the ground with no mercy, I promise you
From Baton Rouge to Cashville, niggas gon' ride for Boos'
So what you saying? Yeah, don't tell me, you don't wan' see my mind twisted
Oh, you pussy talking like these bitches, when I see you that's your issue, nigga
