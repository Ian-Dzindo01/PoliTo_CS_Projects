I heard they speaking on my name
They do it all for the fame
Paid attention how you changed
Know that I'll never change
Know they ain't feelin' my pain
Yea, yea yea
2016 I got locked in that cell and they ain't let me out
Money I'm talking, you know that I'm ballin' I'm hustlin' and I ain't never seen a drought
Spending this cash, but I can not forget to make sure that all my niggas on
Spending this money no question do I think about it, I'll never say that I don't
Walk off alone, when I talk on the phone, dropping the price and you know that they on
Soon as we get it, you know that its gone
I swear that we been at this shit for so long
Momma ask for something and I tell her no
She tell me I ain't shit, and act like I'm wrong
